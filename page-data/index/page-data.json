I'm Greg, a software engineer beginning my career in Jacksonville, FL. I enjoy building web-based applications focusing on both frontend and backend environments, particularly in the .NET ecosystem. I'm passionate about improving technology and applying my logical nature to the field of computer science. I believe the technology we can create has the ability to improve our lives and those around us, and having a role in that is my career goal. I'm also interested in the human aspect of technology, including both those who use it and those who build it. I spend my free time tinkering with the latest JavaScript framework, living on coffee, and playing guitar for my two cats.","aboutImage":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.7142857142857143,"src":"/static/99a43881af925e4d65ca13dfbaf7fe3a/25252/professional_for_web.jpg.jpg","srcSet":"/static/99a43881af925e4d65ca13dfbaf7fe3a/fd013/professional_for_web.jpg.jpg 200w,\n/static/99a43881af925e4d65ca13dfbaf7fe3a/25252/professional_for_web.jpg.jpg 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}},"technologyTitle":"Languages and Technology","technologyContent":{"items":["C#","ASP.NET","JavaScript","SQL","React","Redux","MongoDB","Git","HTML","CSS"]},"experiencesTitle":"Experiences","experiencesContent":[{"employer":"SS&C Advent","title":"Software Engineer","subtitle":"January 2020 - Present","content":{"items":["Enhance and maintain features of a web-based wealth management platform","Develop frontend solutions with React/Redux","Build backend code using C# in .NET in addition to SQL and MongoDB","Oversee my code from planning and research, through development and testing, to production deployment","Participate in an Agile team and contribute to code review","Utilize Git version control"]}},{"employer":"University of North Florida","title":"Lab Assistant/Tutor","subtitle":"August 2019 - December 2019","content":{"items":["Provide academic assistance to university students on the subjects of C, C++, Java, Computational Structures and Data Structures","Engage with students of varying academic levels (first to fourth year) to supplement their understanding of their current classes","Responsible for computer lab lock-up procedures at the end of the night"]}},{"employer":"Five STAR Veterans Center","title":"Web Consultant","subtitle":"June 2019 - May 2020","content":{"items":["Planned and designed potential website updates","Implemented updates after receiving approval from Chief Administrative Officer","Coordinated changes with designated company employees","Oversaw whole product lifecycle","Received feedback of increased traffic to the website"]}}],"featuredTitle":"Featured projects","featuredContent":[{"title":"COVID19 Near Me","titleUrl":"https://gregmurray.org/covid19-near-me/","content":"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself constantly just trying to get simple statistics about number of cases and deaths in my area and across the world.
