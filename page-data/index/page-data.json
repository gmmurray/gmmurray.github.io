I'm Greg, a software engineer residing in Jacksonville, FL. I enjoy building web-based applications focusing on both frontend and backend environments, particularly in the .NET ecosystem. I'm passionate about improving technology and applying my logical nature to the field of computer science. I believe the technology we can create has the ability to improve our lives and those around us, and having a role in that is my career goal. I'm also interested in the human aspect of technology, including both those who use it and those who build it. I spend my free time tinkering with the latest JavaScript framework, living on coffee, and playing guitar for my two cats.","aboutImage":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAv/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCA//aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABy9UosuRsXEaAlWGsf//EABwQAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECACIDERIxMv/aAAgBAQABBQLqcZqN5xrVkVSaxzXIoJ//xAAaEQEAAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEQABEBIx/9oACAEDAQE/ASZN57Wqz//EABwRAAEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAATEDEBETIv/aAAgBAgEBPwEqvTYhbBQxb//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESECECNB/9oACAEBAAY/AinqvToQ2SjAR//EAB0QAQADAAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExEEFRcaH/2gAIAQEAAT8hQFuERQi30Gm67Kma9r4eIl+iPPMORvYkZk2p/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABB/973/xAAZEQABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARARIWH/2gAIAQMBAT8QrDDECn//xAAZEQEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABAhMWH/2gAIAQIBAT8Q3DqhrlBn/8QAHBABAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBgaHh/9oACAEBAAE/EHCgbXiV+IvSRkbAxRFqpBHRfweRkomlBZwxcKHYtl7T3LA2G+2f/9k=","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/8841830f24b8838c515b4e46e71d8b6f/2f1b1/IMG_4396.JPG.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8841830f24b8838c515b4e46e71d8b6f/fd013/IMG_4396.JPG.jpg 200w,\n/static/8841830f24b8838c515b4e46e71d8b6f/25252/IMG_4396.JPG.jpg 400w,\n/static/8841830f24b8838c515b4e46e71d8b6f/2f1b1/IMG_4396.JPG.jpg 800w,\n/static/8841830f24b8838c515b4e46e71d8b6f/0ff54/IMG_4396.JPG.jpg 1200w,\n/static/8841830f24b8838c515b4e46e71d8b6f/06655/IMG_4396.JPG.jpg 1600w,\n/static/8841830f24b8838c515b4e46e71d8b6f/ced94/IMG_4396.JPG.jpg 1760w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"technologyTitle":"Languages and Technology","technologyContent":{"items":["C#","NodeJS","Javascript","Typescript","SQL","HTML","CSS","ASP.NET","MongoDB","React","Redux","NextJS","Git"]},"experiencesTitle":"Experiences","experiencesContent":[{"employer":"SS&C Advent","title":"Software Engineer","subtitle":"January 2020 - Present","content":{"items":["Intern part-time spring 2020, promoted to full-time Associate Software Engineer September 2020, promoted to Software Engineer September 2021","Enhance and maintain features of a web-based wealth management platform","Develop frontend solutions with React/Redux","Build backend code using C# in .NET in addition to SQL and MongoDB","Oversee my code from planning and research, through development and testing, to production deployment","Participate in an Agile team and contribute to code review","Utilize Git version control"]}},{"employer":"Isotropic","title":"Technical Writer","subtitle":"May 2022 - December 2022","content":{"items":["Wrote for a tech blog with content focused on JavaScript and other frontend technologies","Created and published short tutorials, 'how-to' articles, and bug fixes","Ensured content was informative, easy to follow, and technically accurate","Utilized clear, concise, and engaging writing style","Aimed to deliver high-quality content accessible to a wide range of programming backgrounds","Made blog posts SEO friendly to increase visibility and reach","Refined understanding of JavaScript concepts and techniques","Translated complex technical concepts into simple, easy-to-understand language","Honed research skills and became adept at finding reliable and up to date sources for information","Delivered content promptly through work with project manager","Proposed new blog post ideas and saw those ideas through to publication"]}},{"employer":"University of North Florida","title":"Lab Assistant/Tutor","subtitle":"August 2019 - December 2019","content":{"items":["Provide academic assistance to university students on the subjects of C, C++, Java, Computational Structures and Data Structures","Engage with students of varying academic levels (first to fourth year) to supplement their understanding of their current classes","Responsible for computer lab lock-up procedures at the end of the night"]}},{"employer":"Five STAR Veterans Center","title":"Web Consultant","subtitle":"June 2019 - May 2020","content":{"items":["Planned and designed potential website updates","Implemented updates after receiving approval from Chief Administrative Officer","Coordinated changes with designated company employees","Oversaw whole product lifecycle","Received feedback of increased traffic to the website"]}}],"featuredTitle":"Featured projects","featuredContent":[{"title":"This website","titleUrl":"https://gregmurray.org/","content":"I built this personal website primarly to replace the first iteration of my website which is a very simple HTML/CSS website.

This app is the latest iteration of that app which I created in preparation for the 2021 holiday season. Users can create wish lists for themselves by adding gifts that they would like. Every group they join will then provide those group members with access to each user's wish list. Everyone in the group can claim gifts and coordinate to knock out each item in everyone's list.
