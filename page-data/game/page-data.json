I'm Greg, a software engineer residing in Jacksonville, FL. I enjoy building web-based applications focusing on both frontend and backend environments, particularly in the .NET ecosystem. I'm passionate about improving technology and applying my logical nature to the field of computer science. I believe the technology we can create has the ability to improve our lives and those around us, and having a role in that is my career goal. I'm also interested in the human aspect of technology, including both those who use it and those who build it. I spend my free time tinkering with the latest JavaScript framework, living on coffee, and playing guitar for my two cats.","technologyContent":{"items":["C#","NodeJS","Javascript","Typescript","SQL","HTML","CSS","ASP.NET","MongoDB","React","Redux","NextJS","Git"]},"technologyTree":{"items":[{"id":"1","code":"fa-solid fa-code","title":"Frontend Specialization","total":1,"points":1,"content":"Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website."},{"id":"4","code":"fa-brands fa-html5","title":"HTML","total":5,"parent":"1","points":5,"content":"The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser."},{"id":"5","code":"fa-brands fa-css3","title":"CSS","total":5,"parent":"1","points":4,"content":"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

During the 2020 holiday season I made an app called Group Gift to help my family organize wish lists between everyone. This app is the latest iteration of that app which I created in preparation for the 2021 holiday season. Users can create wish lists for themselves by adding gifts that they would like. Every group they join will then provide those group members with access to each user's wish list. Everyone in the group can claim gifts and coordinate to knock out each item in everyone's list. It is a React app that employs [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for styling, [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) combined with [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for auth, persistence and querying optimization, and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for easier forms.

He wanted to be able to keep track of recipes on various websites, without needing to print them. I took that opportunity to make this app which is a straight forward recipe book. You can save and preview links to recipes and also add notes to them. I also added a simple dashboard to help each user find their favorite recipes quicker and even help recommend where to find new ones. I used [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication/authorization which I have been really enjoying learning lately. It may come as no surprise then that I used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) which has become my go to for React development these days.

As usual I have used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React Material UI](https://mui.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Additionally I am using MongoDB for data and I tried out using [Atlas' Data API](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/app-services/data-api) so that I could properly access MongoDB from a serverless environment.

If you haven't already, please go check it out! This is one of the most extensive projects I have done that really pushed my boundaries of programming. Long story short, I had the idea of presenting this website to any of my more playfully inclined visitors in video game format. That means a browser based (JavaScript!!), classic 2D RPG style game that contains *all* of the same information that this web page has but in game format. It's possible that you are reading this right now from inside the game which would be incredibly meta. Anyway, I learned a lot about [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) (the game engine I used), programming from a more performant perspective, and simple game theory. Stay tuned as I will be writing a blog post about it all soon...","createdAt":"2023-02-12T00:10:33.410446+00:00","image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.0416666666666667,"src":"/static/d8be470e1aea3b1b70b3d418b6933672/90823/featured_game.png.png","srcSet":"/static/d8be470e1aea3b1b70b3d418b6933672/dc47e/featured_game.png.png 200w,\n/static/d8be470e1aea3b1b70b3d418b6933672/9f2d5/featured_game.png.png 400w,\n/static/d8be470e1aea3b1b70b3d418b6933672/90823/featured_game.png.png 800w,\n/static/d8be470e1aea3b1b70b3d418b6933672/1a799/featured_game.png.png 952w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"techTags":{"items":["JavaScript","Phaser","Game Dev","Object Oriented Programming"]},"iconName":"fa-solid fa-gamepad","iconColor":"#ebaa02"},{"title":"My Blog","titleUrl":"https://blog.gregmurray.org/","content":"I have created a programming/software dev/personal blog as an extension of this website.
