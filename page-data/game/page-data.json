I'm Greg, a software engineer residing in Jacksonville, FL. I enjoy building web-based applications focusing on both frontend and backend environments, particularly in the .NET ecosystem.

I believe the technology we can create has the ability to improve our lives and those around us, and having a role in that is my career goal. I'm also interested in the human aspect of technology, including both those who use it and those who build it.

During the 2020 holiday season I made an app called Group Gift to help my family organize wish lists between everyone. This app is the latest iteration of that app which I created in preparation for the 2021 holiday season. Users can create wish lists for themselves by adding gifts that they would like. Every group they join will then provide those group members with access to each user's wish list. Everyone in the group can claim gifts and coordinate to knock out each item in everyone's list. It is a React app that employs [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for styling, [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) combined with [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for auth, persistence and querying optimization, and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for easier forms.

My dad has been getting into cooking and therefore recipes but he's printing them out and described how cluttered having physical copies is. He wanted to be able to keep track of recipes on various websites, without needing to print them. I took that opportunity to make this app which is a straight forward recipe book. You can save and preview links to recipes and also add notes to them. I also added a simple dashboard to help each user find their favorite recipes quicker and even help recommend where to find new ones. I used [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication/authorization which I have been really enjoying learning lately. It may come as no surprise then that I used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) which has become my go to for React development these days. I just love the boilerplate that is taken care of, particularly with routing. I also used [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as usual plus [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/react) for easy to set up forms.
