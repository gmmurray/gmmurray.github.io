export const aboutMe =
  "Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Greg, a recent computer science graduate working as a software engineer. I enjoy building web-based applications focusing on both frontend and backend environments, particularly in the .NET ecosystem. I'm passionate about improving technology and applying my logical nature to the field of computer science. I believe the technology we can create has the ability to improve our lives and those around us, and having a role in that is my career goal. I spend my free time tinkering with the latest JavaScript framework, living on coffee, and playing guitar for my two cats."
